# 🌟 Web Animations & Functionality Project

Welcome to the **Web Animations & Functionality Project** repository! This repository showcases various examples of web animations and interactive features implemented using two approaches: `vanilla-js` (pure JavaScript) and `GSAP` (GreenSock Animation Platform). Each example is organized into folders, and each example has a unique number for easy reference.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized into main directories:


### 🛠️ Structure

Every example follows a simple folder structure:

```
/css
    └── main.css
/js
    └── main.js
/img
    └── (optional: stores images used in the example)
index.html
```

## 📑 Index of Examples

### Vanilla JS

1. **01-mouse-animation**: Mouse animation tracking user movements across the page.
2. **02-parallax-effect**: Simple parallax effect based on scroll position.

### GSAP

1. **01-mouse-animation**: Enhanced mouse animation using GSAP for smoother transitions.
2. **02-parallax-effect**: Advanced parallax effect with GSAP, allowing for more dynamic interactions.

## 🎮 How to Run

To run any example, simply open the `index.html` file located inside each example's folder. The example should work right away in your browser. Ensure that the required CSS and JavaScript files are properly linked.
